# CrackMe-IntroComputerSystems
A project that myself and another team member, Joseph Zuniga, worked on. Involved removing malicious code from an unknown executable using Ghidra, an open source reverse engineering tool developed by the NSA

## IMPORTANT!
The original executables, a Windows and Mac version, are included in the zip file, DO NOT OPEN THESE! they still contain malicious code, they are only there for anyone that would like to look at the executables within a decompiler / disassembler!
